# Ionic App with Nuxt

Testing/learning Ionic.

## Live Reload

Make sure to have the dev server running in a separate terminal.

```bash
nr dev --host
```

In `scripts/android.sh` replace the `LIP` with the Nuxt server's network address.

Run the app.

```bash
nr android
```

Once it is installed the terminal instance can be closed. Anytime the app is opened on the device it will connect to the Nuxt dev server.
