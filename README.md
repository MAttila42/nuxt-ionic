# Ionic App with Nuxt

Testing/learning Ionic.

## Setup

Install node modules.

```bash
ni
```

That's it. No more setup needed. Everything gets created when needed.

## Live Reload

Make sure to have the dev server running in a separate terminal.

```bash
nr dev --host
```

Run the app with the Nuxt server's network address.

```bash
nr android <host>
```

Once it is installed the terminal instance can be closed. Anytime the app is opened on the device it will connect to the Nuxt dev server.
